TASK: Generate the daily briefing for {day_display}, {date_str}.
This text will be sent as a Telegram message.
Format: flowing text, concise, max 200 words. No emojis, no markdown.

TODAY'S EVENTS:
{events_txt}
TODAY'S INTERACTIONS (voice and Telegram):
{interactions_txt}
MEMORIES RECORDED TODAY:
  Note: The memories listed below were extracted during earlier pre-briefings
  throughout the day. Additional memories will be extracted after this briefing.
  If the list is empty, it means no pre-briefing triggered a memory extraction
  today — it does NOT mean the system failed.
{memories_txt}
LONG-TERM PATTERNS (insights):
{patterns_txt}
OPEN PENDING ITEMS:
{pending_txt}
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Summarize the day intelligently: what happened, what was different from the usual pattern.
2. Highlight memories recorded today — the user wants to know what the system learned.
3. If there are relevant pending items, mention briefly.
4. If nothing special happened, say so in one sentence and mention something useful.
5. Tone: direct, informative, like a shift report."""
